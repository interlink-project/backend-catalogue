# How to use this INTERLINKER
This document provides information and guidance on functionalities integrated in the INTERLINK
Collaborative Environment to support recognition and transparency of participants' contribution
and to incentivize active participation.
Activities performed during the co-production process by participants can be counted and
assigned a virtual value (points) that can potentially be converted into rewards. Points can also be
used to create a visual rendering of the joint efforts that have contributed to co-production. Both
activities performed inside the INTERLINK digital platform and activities performed offline during
physical meetings can be registered.
