# How to use this INTERLINKER
 This kit contains a checklist and links to requirements to be handed out to participants engaged in co-production activities. It briefly explains the procedures of involving stakeholders and collects communication materials like email templates, social cards, and newsletter templates. All the templates and social cards can be tailored according to the specific event/activity/ experiment the participants will be involved in, for example, to spread the correct information about the venue, purposes, and so on.
